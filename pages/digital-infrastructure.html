              <h4>Malware uses sophisticated new tricks to infiltrate. </h4>
              <p>As defenses grow stronger, malware gets more innovative. Attackers are increasingly using cloud-based
                messaging and storage services to blend into legitimate traffic. And some groups are experimenting with
                new techniques in encryption and code obfuscation to go unnoticed. </p>

              <h4>In the age of triple extortion , business partners may put you on at risk </h4>
              <p>Triple extortion is an increasingly popular tactic of encrypting and stealing data, while also
                threatening to expose the data publicly and engage in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
                against the affected organization unless a ransom is paid. Ransomware gangs are also looking to their
                primary victim’s business partners to pressure them into paying a ransom to prevent their own data
                leakages or business disruptions caused by a ransomware attack. Triple extortion is particularly
                problematic because the victims’ networks are held hostage with two kinds of malicious attacks, and they
                are further victimized by the theft and leakage of data.</p>

              <p>As businesses, institutions and governments continue to adapt to a fast-changing global
                market—including hybrid and cloud-based work environments—threat actors remain adept at exploiting such
                shifts. </p>
